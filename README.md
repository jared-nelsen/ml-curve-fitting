# ML Curve Fitting

Curve fitting with Genetic Algorithms

## Genetic Algorithm

   - Fix Imports
   - Fix generate population
   - Fix Algorithm Context

## Reporter

   - Fix fitness used

## Core

   - Point core to algorithm

## Evaluation

   - M evenly spaced points will be selected between [0 -> 1]
   - The explicit formula for a point on a Bezier curve will be used to calculate a
     point for each M
